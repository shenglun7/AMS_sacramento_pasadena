## Summary
This repository is for data analysis of results from AMS measurements from UCD Mobile Smog Chamber Systems in Sacramento (2020), and Pasadena (2021). The goal of this project is to understand the response of aerosol formation (i.e., SOA, inorganic aerosols) to the perturbation of NOx and VOCs in the ambient air in California.
This repository contains data, code, result.
